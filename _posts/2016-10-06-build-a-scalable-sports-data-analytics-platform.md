### Introduction

	>"Of course, you would like all those stats." -- Sara Sidle to Gil Grissom: CSI

Among all kinds of sports fans, there is one category that specifically loves analyzing, often this part of fans love tactics and stats/data to justify what they thought. Usually fans love stats also make predictions and like playing "digging game" (like fantasy football/baseball/basketball players, and Soccer FM managers), it would not just be making watching/reading game more enjoyable but also convert sports to a chess game, giving them extra interest and different angle that no other fans could see.

Honestly, lots of fans love analyzing having their own way to address the data/stats, and generally they have the ability to handle the data as well, meanwhile, lots of data are not big enough to be treated as "big data" which means Excel sheet with VBA script could get us very meaningful conclusion and undiscovered finding already. However, if we want to digg even deeper, we would have ability to achieve even more and enjoy even more.

That is the reason I am writing the series to build a scalable data platform, for lots of purposes Excel would be already enough, but using this series as examples and boilerplate project, we should be able to get more. Hope it could be helpful and more importantly, inspirational.
